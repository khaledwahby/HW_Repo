    Q1
Design an OOP model for planning trip fuel across multiple vehicle types.
Requirements:
- Provide a general vehicle type with encapsulated core data (private fields) and validated constructors
(invalid ® print an error; keep previous values).
- Create at least two specialized vehicle types that inherit from the general type and introduce one
private field each affecting fuel usage, with validation.
- Define a fuel computation method in the general type; specialized types must override it with their own
rule.
- In a mixed collection of vehicles, given a list of trip distances, compute total fuel per vehicle and print
which vehicles cannot complete the route under their own constraints (you define the constraint per
type).
