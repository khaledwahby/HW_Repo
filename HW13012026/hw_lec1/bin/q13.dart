void main() {
  /*
   Question 13
    What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer: ```dart void main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ```
  */

  // the output will be 11 because the * operator precedence is higher than the + operator precedence, so the multiplication will be performed first and then the addition

  // first 2 * 3 = 6
  // second x + 6 = 5 + 6 = 11
}
