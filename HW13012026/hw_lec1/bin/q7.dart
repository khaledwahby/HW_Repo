void main() {
  /*

Question 7
    Given this code, identify any errors and explain why they occur: ```dart void main(){ String name = "Alice"; name = 123; pri(name); } 
  */

  // the name variable is explicitly declared as a string, trying to assign any other datatype value other than a string to the name variable will cause an error. so the command name = 123 will raise an error.
}
