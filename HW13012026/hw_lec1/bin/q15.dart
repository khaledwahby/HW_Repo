   Question 15
    What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it impact the way variables are used?
  */

  //statically-typed means that the data type of a variable should be settled before the program runs otherwise it will produce a compilation error

  //That impact the way variables are used, when declaring a variable, you should explicitly declare it with a datatype using (int, string, bool, double, dynamic) or using var keyword which will also give a datatype to the variable, so in all cases the compiler should be informed what is the data type of the variable before the program can be compiled.
